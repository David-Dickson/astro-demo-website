      <h2>About Astro</h2>
      <p>
        Astro is a Static Site Generator (SSG). Build your pages in <code
          >.astro</code
        > files (very close to HTML/JSX) and sparkle them with React/Vue/Preact/Svelte
        components. It deals with file-based routing and templates neutrally. Bring
        your component framework.
      </p>

        <h3>Use the tools you already love</h3>
        <p>
          Bring your own component framework. Astro offers first-class support
          for front-end tools like React, Vue, Svelte, and Tailwind CSS. Avoid
          confusing configuration and get started in seconds: just type
          <code> astro add</code> .
        </p>
      </Card>

      <h3>Deploy to anywhere, even the edge</h3>
      <img class="logos" src={logos} alt="" />
      <img class="logos-small" src={logosSmall} alt="" />
      <p>
        Astro supports both static output (SSG) and live server output (SSR). No
        matter what you choose to build, Astro's flexible adapter system makes
        deployment setup and configuration a breeze.
